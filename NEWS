Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc. changes bumps the patch


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 2.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `bag_o_words` did not make use of the `bag_o_words2` helper function that has 
  finer grained control of the output.  `...` were ignored but now are respected.

* `fry` threw an error if a group contained < 300 words but had enough text to
  generate 2 texts chunks of 100 words each, caught by S. Enrico P. Indiogine.
  The bug has been fixed as these groups are dropped and a warning given.

* `phrase_net` threw an error caused by **dplyr**'s (0.3) approach to subsetting 
  columns.  Proviously a vector was returned, now a `tbl_df` object is returned: 
  https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/issues/587. This was adtreeded by using 
  explicit `df[[index]]` rather than `df[, index]`.

NEW FEATURES

* `chunker` added to break text, optionally by grouping variables, into equal 
  chunks.  The chunk size can be specified by giving number of words to be in 
  each chunk or the number of chunks.

IMPROVEMENTS

  `all_words` gains `char.keep` and `char2space` arguments to enable retention 
  of characters and multi word phrases.  These features are passed to 
  `freq_terms` as well.  Suggestd by stackoverflow's lawyeR 
  (http://stackoverflow.com/a/26162401/1000343).

CHANGES

* `rm_url` has been moved into its own canned regex pattern extraction/replacer
  package named `qdapRegex`.

* `name2sex` now uses the **gender** package to predict sex.  This makes the 
  function slightly slower but much more accurate than previous versions.  
  Because of this increased accuracy and dependence on `gender`, the arguments 
  `pred.sex`, `fuzzy.match`, and `database` are no longer necessary and have 
  been removed.


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 2.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `syllable_count` returned the sentence (recycled) in the `words` column of the
  output.  This behavior has been fixed.  See GitHub issue #188 for details.

* `syn` returned antonyms for some words.  This was caused by the dictionary:
  `qdapDictionaries::key.syn` contained antonyms and elemets the were error 
  messages (character).  This has been fixed.  Reference issue #190. (Jingjing Zou)

* The `pres_debates2012` data set contained three errors in speech attribution.
  This has been corrected and the turn of talk (`tot`) as well.

* `word_stats` would throw an error if no poly-syllable words existed.  This has 
  been corrected (reported by Nicolas Turenne).

NEW FEATURES

* `qdap_df` and `%&%` added to mimic some of the functionality of `dplyr`'s 
  `tbl_df` and chaining pipe in a more specific, less flexible, `qdap` oriented 
  way.

* `Text` added to view and change the `text.var` attribute of a `data.frame of 
  the class `qdap_df`.

* `cumulative` generic method added to view cumulative scores over time.

* `formality` picks up a `cumulative` method.

* `polarity` picks up a `cumulative` method.

* `end_mark` picks up a `class` (`end_mark`), `plot` method, and a `cumulative` 
  method.

* `syllable_sum`, `polysyllable_sum`, and `combo_syllable_sum` pick up a 
  `class`, `plot` method, and a `cumulative` method.

* `wfm` becomes a generic method currently applied to a `text.var` that is:
  `character`, `factor` (coerced to `character`), or `wfdf`.

* `unbag` added as a compliment to `bag_o_words` and friends for undoing string 
  splitting.  A convenience wrapper for `paste(collapse = " ")`.

* `as.Corpus.TermDocumentMatrix`, `as.Corpus.DocumentTermMatrix`, and 
  `as.Corpus.wfm` added to convert a matrix format to a `tm::Corpus`.

* `exclude` becomes a generic method for various classes.  Functionality is the 
  same but with improved code readability.

* `check_spelling_interactive`, `check_spelling`, `which_misspelled`, and 
  `correct` allow the user to identify potentially misspelled words and 
  optionally suggest replacements.

* `random_data` & `random_sent` added to generate random sentence data sets and 
  vectors.

* `comma_spacer` added to ensure strings with commas contain a space after them.

* `check_text` added to identify potential problems in text.

* `replace_ordinal` added to convert ordinal representations of 1 through 100 to
  strictly ordinal text (e.g., "1st" becomes "first").

* A vignette: `Cleaning Text & Debugging` was added to assist users with 
  cleaning and debugging problems in `qdap`.

* `pronoun_type`, and `subject_pronoun_type`, `object_pronoun_type` added to 
  examine usage of subject/object pronouns by grouping variable.

MINOR FEATURES

* `dplyr`'s chaining pipe imported for convenience.  See 
  http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/magrittr/functions/magrittr for details.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `wfm` gains a speedup through generic classes and `tm` package integration 
  (`strip` is no longer used in `wfm`).

* `as.tdm.character` and `as.dtm.character` gain a speed boost with a `tm` 
  package integration.

* Added message to `as.data.frame.Corpus` for missing end-marks suggesting the 
  use of: `sent.split = FALSE`.

* `as.Corpus` familiy of functions didn't necessarily respect document names and
  sometimes used numeric sequence instead.  The introduction of a reader via
  `tm::readTabular` has fixed this.

* `sentSplit` now gives warnings for text that may contain anomalies such as:
  non-ASCII characters, factors, missing punctuation, empty cells, and no 
  alphabetic characters found.

* `read.transcript` now gives a warning when reading from a .docx file and the 
  separator (`sep`) used is still found in the text as this may indicate the 
  data did not split correctly.

* `dispersion_plot` now takes a named list of vectors of terms as the argument to 
  `match.terms`.  The vectors are combined as a unified theme named with the 
  names of the list supplied to `match.terms`.

CHANGES

* `as.data.frame.Corpus`'s default value for `sent.split` is now `FALSE`.

* The `state` column in the `qdap::DATA2` data-set is now character (previously 
  factor).

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 2.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `new_project` did not copy the .Rprofile over into the new project. This has 
  been fixed. Reference issue #184.

* `sentiment_frame` coerced words to factor.  `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` has 
  been added to prevent this.

* `polarity` did not work on > 1 grams due to a bug in `sentiment_frame` 
  converting character to factor (thanks for the find @chewth). See GitHub 
  issue #185 for details.

NEW FEATURES

* `unique_by` added to allow the user to find terms unique to individual 
  elements of a grouping variable.

* `build_qdap_vignette` replaces the temporary place holder version of the 
  *Introduction to qdap vignette*.  This function will replace the (1) HTML, 
  (2) source, & (3) R code found in `browseVignettes(package = 'qdap')`.

MINOR FEATURES

* `sub_holder` picks up a `alpha.type` argument that allows the user to specify 
  whether alpha or numeric keys should be used.

* `replace_number` picks up a `remove` argument that removes numbers from text.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `qheat` becomes a generic method.  This means some of the internal function 
  class checking has been moved to individual methods for those classes.  
  Additionally, `qheat` now works with logical matrices/data.frames.

* The `tm` package compatibility functions have been renamed in a more R-ish
  way and take the form of generic methods for specific classes.  For example,
  `df2tm_corpus` becomes `as.Corpus`.  Here is a complete list of changes:

    - `df2tm_courpus` is now  `as.Corpus`
    - `tm_corpus2df` is now `as.data.frame`
    - `as.wfm` is now a generic method
    - `tm_corpus2wfm` is now `as.wfm`
    - `tm2qdap` is now `as.wfm`
    - `tdm` is now `as.tdm` or `as.TermDocumentMatrix` 
    - `dtm` is now `as.dtm` or `as.DocumentTermMatrix`

CHANGES

* `colsplit2df` and `colpaste2df` no longer convert character columns to factor.

* `df2tm_corpus` is deprecated.  It will be removed in a subsequent version of 
  `qdap`.  Use `as.Corpus` instead.

* `tm_corpus2df` is deprecated.  It will be removed in a subsequent version of 
  `qdap`.  Use `as.data.frame` instead.

* `tm2qdap` is deprecated.  It will be removed in a subsequent version of 
  `qdap`.  Use `as.wfm` instead.

* `tm_corpus2wfm` is deprecated.  It will be removed in a subsequent version of 
  `qdap`.  Use `as.wfm` instead.

* `tdm` is deprecated.  It will be removed in a subsequent version of `qdap`.  
  Use `as.tdm` or `as.TermDocumentMatrix` instead.

* `dtm` is deprecated.  It will be removed in a subsequent version of `qdap`.  
  Use `as.dtm` or `as.DocumentTermMatrix` instead.

* The *Introduction to qdap* .Rmd vignette has been moved to an internal 
  directory.  The HTML version is not built by default.  This saves CRAN space 
  and time checking the package source.  The file has been replaced with a
  temporary place holder that contains instructions for building the actual 
  vignette.  The user may also use the `build_qdap_vignette` directly.

* `qdap` incorporates the changes from the `tm` package version: 0.6:
  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/news.html  Reference issue #187.

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 2.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

The `qdapTools` package now houses several former qdap functions.  While 
  `qdapTools` is a Dependency and all of these functions will be accessible to 
  the qdap user there is a break in backward compatibility if these functions
  are included in code.  For this reason this release is a major bump of qdap.


BUG FIXES

* `replace_number` did not replace single digits numbers.  Spotted by Ben Bolker.
  This behavior has been fixed and unit testing added for this function. See
  issue # 178.

NEW FEATURES

* `sub_holder` added; this function holds the place for particular character 
  values, allowing the user to manipulate the vector and then revert the place
  holders back to the original values.

* `Network` method added to make network plots of select qdap objects.  

* `qtheme`, `theme_nightheat`, `theme_duskheat`, theme_norah`, `theme_cafe`, 
  `theme_grayscale`, `theme_badkitchen`, and `theme_hipster` added to style 
  `Network` plots.

* `polarity` picks up a `Network` method.

* `formality` picks up a `Network` method.

* qdap officially begins utilizing the `testthat` package for unit testing, 
  though only a few functions have begun the process, more will be added over 
  time.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

CHANGES

* The `qdapTools` package now houses the following former `qdap` functions:
  `hash`, `%ha%`, `hash_look`, `hms2sec`, `id`, `lookup`, `%l%`, `%l+%`, `%l*%`, 
  `repo2github`, `sec2hms`, `text2color`, `url_dl`, `v_outer`, `list2df`, 
  `matrix2df`, `vect2df`, `list_df2df`, `list_vect2df`, `counts2list`,  
  `vect2list`, & `mtabulate`.  These functions will continue to be available to 
  qdap users in interactive mode (`qdapTools` is a Dependency and thus these 
  functions are loaded into the workspace by default).  This will allow this 
  bundle of functions to be used outside of qdap without calling the larger qdap 
  package per the request of Kirill Muller (see issue #165).

* As scheduled the `dissimilarity` function has been removed from the qdap 
  package to avoid conflict with the `tm` package.  Use `Dissimilarity` function 
  instead.


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.6
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR FEATURES

* `polarity` picks up a `constrain` argument that constrains the polarity values
  to be between -1 and 1.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `polarity`'s equation now uses primes on the de-amplifiers before they're 
  confined to be >= -1.  This avoids confusion in the indicator function that 
  took the de-amplifiers variable and returned the same variable.

* `dist_tab`'s frequency columns used a capital F in Freq.  This was not 
  consistent across all column names and has been changed to lower case.

CHANGES

* `polarity_frame` is deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release.
  Please use `sentiment_frame` instead.


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.5
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* The An Introduction to qdap vignette contained a broken link in the tm 
  Package Compatibility section.  This has been fixed.  Also the reliance on 
  `Rgraphviz` from the vignette has been removed.  This will eliminate CRAN
  WARN in CRAN checks (for some OS) but not the note for `tm`'s reliance on 
  `Rgraphviz`.

* `polarity` reported the incorrect number of words for sentences containing 
  commas.  This has been fixed (Max Ghenis).

NEW FEATURES

* `formality` picks up an `Animate` method.

* `end_mark_by` function added as a aggregated grouping version of `end_mark`.

MINOR FEATURES

* `raj.act.1POS` added.  `raj.act.1POS` is a data set for Romeo and Juliet: Act 1
  broken into parts of speech.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `discourse_map` picks up a `pause` argument that enables the user to pause 
  between plots in interactive mode.

CHANGES

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.4
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

NEW FEATURES

* `gantt` and `gantt_wrap` (single facet) pick up and `Animate` method.

* `polarity` picks up an `Animate` method.

* `vertex_apply` and `edge` apply added to make uniform changes to lists of 
  `igraph` objects.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

* `discourse_map` picks up a `condense` argument that allows the user to 
  condense sequential rows for like grouping variable sub groups.

* `list_df2df` names now use a zero padded numeric portion for default names.  
  For example `c("L1", "L2", "L3", ... "L10")`, becomes 
  `c("L01", "L02", "L03", ... "L10")`.

CHANGES

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `colpaste2df` dropped the column name for a single retained column when 
  `keep.orig = FALSE`.  See GitHub issue #157 for more.

* `multigsub` (`mgsub`) would return `NA` for replacement of length 1 after the 
  addition of the `order.pattern` (used to prevent substrings from 
  replacing meta-strings) in version 1.3.2.

NEW FEATURES

* `phrase_net` function provides functioning similar to the Many Eyes 
  Phrase Net plot.

* `discourse_map` function provides a network mapping of the flow of discourse 
  between social actors.  Function output is `Animate` ready as well.  See
  `?discourse_map` and http://trinker.github.io/qdap_examples/animation_dialogue
  for more.

* `Animate` function added to convert select qdap outputs to an animated  
  sequence.  See `?Animate.discourse_map` for more.

MINOR FEATURES

* `synonyms_frame` (`syn_frame`) added to allow the user to create a synonym
  hash for the revamped `synonyms` function.

* `repo2github` function added to send a directory to GitHub upon first commit.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `new_project` has an improved directory structure and works with any version 
  of the `reports` package.

* `synonyms` function used the `env.syl` hash data from qdapDictionaries 
  internally.  This approach could cause problems if used within other functions
  in a package.  It also limits the usability of synonyms.  The `synonyms` 
  function picks up a `synonym.frame` argument that allows the user to specify
  a synonym hash table.  This can be created via the `synonyms_frame` function
  (per a request from J. Aravind).

CHANGES


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a patch release to address the archiving of the `lsa` package.


BUG FIXES

* The **qdap-tm Package Compatibility** Vignette contained an error in the 
  Feinerer I, Hornik K, Meyer D (2008) reference (pages listed as 51-54 has been 
  corrected to pages 1-54 as well as incorrect journal). Caught by Kurt Hornik.

MINOR FEATURES

* `DocumentTermMatrix` and `TermDocumentMatrix` from the tm package pick up a 
  `Filter` method.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `multigsub` picks up an argument, `order.pattern`, to prevent substrings from 
  replacing meta-strings.

* The following data sets were added to qdapDictionaries package: 
    `Fry_1000`, `Leveled_Dolch`, `Dolch`

CHANGES

* The package `lsa` has been removed from Suggests field in the DESCRIPTIONN 
  file, examples, and vignettes.


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

A version bump necessary for Re-Submission to CRAN.  

CHANGES

* `new_project` was reconfigured with the old code that does not require the 
  newest version of the reports package.

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `read.transcript` could leave a QDAP_PLACE_HOLDER behind if a colon was found 
  in the person column.  This behavior has been fixed.

* `word_cor`'s plotting method threw an error if a word did not have any words 
  above the r threshold.  This behavior has been corrected.

* `Filter` overwrote a base R function; this has been fixed per Joshua Ulrich.

* `scores.polarity`'s print method would return an error if columns were not 
  indexed yet were rounded.  For instance, the following threw an error: 

  `scores(with(sentSplit(DATA, 4), polarity(state, person)))[, 1:4]` 

   This behavior has been fixed.

NEW FEATURES

* qdap adds an HTML vignette to better explain the intended work flow and 
  function use for the package.   Use `browseVignettes(package = "qdap")` to
  open.

* qdap adds a PDF vignette to describe the compatibility and navigation between 
  qdap and the `tm` packages. Use `browseVignettes(package = "qdap")` to open.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

* `apply_as_df` picks up a `stopwords` and `filter` arguments that allows the 
  user to remove stopwords and min/max length words.

* `plot.word_cor` picks up the argument `ncol` that allows the user to specify 
  the number of columns used.  This uses `ggplot2`'s `facet_wrap` rather than 
  `facet_grid` (which is the default if `ncol =NULL`).

* `name2sex` relied upon having qdapDictionaries loaded.  This could be an issue 
  if the function were used internally.  The user now supplies a dictionary of 
  names and probabilities.

* `df2tm_corpus` gains a `demographics.vars` argument that allows the user to 
  add demographic information to the resulting corpus `DMetaDat`.

* `tm_corpus2df` gains the ability to convert `DMetaDat` into demographic 
  data.frame columns.


CHANGES


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

NEW FEATURES

* `Filter` added to give the ability to provide a range of character 
  lengths to filter from a `wfm` object.

* `scores` generic method added to view scores from select qdap objects.

* `counts` generic method added to view counts from select qdap objects.

* `proportions` generic method added to view proportions from select qdap 
  objects.

* `preprocessed` generic method added to view preprocessed data from select qdap 
  objects.

* `apply_as_df` added to allow the user to apply qdap functions to a Corpus 
  directly.

MINOR FEATURES

* `tm_corpus2wfm` added to quickly convert from a tm package `Corpus` to a qdap
  `wfm` object.

* `as.wfm` added as a means to attempt to coerce a matrix to a `wfm` object.

* `%l+%` added as a counterpart to `%l%` that assumes `missing = NULL`.

* `%bs%` added as quick counterpart to `boolean_search` for indexing.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `df2tm_corpus` now sets metaData information for ID and creator (based on) 
  `Sys.info()["user"]`.

* `matrix2df` now accepts a simple_triplet_matrix object as well.

* `word_cor` output that was a list (not a correlation matrix) did not have a 
  plot method.  The plot method for `word_cor` now handles both matrices and the 
  list of correlations.

* `rm_row` picks up the `contains` argument that allows the user to search for, 
  and remove rows of, within the string, not just the beginning.

* `read.transcript` now handles multiple character spaces as an argument to 
  `sep` when `text` argument is used.

CHANGES

* `dissimilarity` has been renamed to `Dissimilarity` to prevent tm package 
  conflicts.  The old version has been deprecated and will be removed in a the
  next version (minor or major) push to CRAN.


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

A version bump necessary for Re-Submission to CRAN.  

CHANGES

* Downgraded the version requirement for the reports package to 
  reports (>= 0.1.2) in order to upload to CRAN.  reports (>= 0.2.0) is not yet
  available on CRAN.

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 1.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

The word lists and dictionaries in `qdap` have been moved to `qdapDictionaries`. 
Additionally, many functions have been renamed with underscores instead of the 
former period separators.  These changes break backward compatibility.  Thus 
this is a **major** release (ver. 1.0.0).

It is the general practice to deprecate functions within a package before 
removal, however, the number of necessary changes in light of qdap being 
relatively new to CRAN, made these changes sensible at this point.


BUG FIXES

* `qheat`'s  argument `by.column = FALSE` resulted in an error.  This behavior 
  has been fixed.

* `question_type` did not work because of changes to `lookup` that did not 
  accept a two column matrix for `key.match`.  See GitHub issue #127 for more.

* `combo_syllable.sum` threw an error if the text.var contained a cell with an 
  all non-character ([a-z]) string.  This behavior has been fixed.

* `todo` function created by `new_project` would not report completed tasks if 
  `report.completed = TRUE`.

* `termco` and `termco.d` threw an error if more than one consecutive regex 
  special character was passed to `match.list` or `match.string`.  See GitHub 
  issue #128 for more. 

* `trans.cloud` threw an error if a single list with a named vector was passed 
  to `target.words`.  This behavior has been fixed.

* `sentSplit` now returns the "tot" column when `text.place = "original"`.  

* `all_words` output dataframe FREQ column class has been changed from factor to 
  numeric.  Additionally, the WORDS column prints using `left.just` but retains
  traditional character properties (print class added).  `all_words` also picks
  up apostrophe.remove and ldots (for `strip`) arguments.

* `gantt_plot` did not handle `fill.vars`, particularly if the fill was nested 
  within the `grouping.vars`.  This behavior has been fixed with corresponding 
  examples added.

* `url_dl` - Downloaded an empty file when not using a Dropbox key.  This 
  behavior has been fixed.

* The `cm_code.` family of functions had a bug in the output due to 
  `cm_long2dummy` and `cm_dummy2long`'s handling of stretching spans.  This has 
  been corrected.

* `cm_code.exclude` did not output the correct excluded spans.  This behavior
  has been corrected.

* The use of `comment` to convey object characteristics has been replaced with 
  the use of `class`.

* `question_type` did not include question words ending in 'd as part of the 
  category.  For instance "How'd you like it?" was not classified as a how 
  question.

* `beg2char` would not include the `char` if `include = TRUE` and `noc = 1`.

* `cm_range2long` returned `NA`s for vectors containing multiple single values.  
  See GitHub issue #144 for more.

* `termco` family of functions did not handle `NA` values.  This has been fixed. 
  (Matt Williamson) See GitHub issue #147 for details.

* `pos` threw an error for vectors of length 1.  This has been fixed (Kurt 
  Hornik). See GitHub issue #150 for details.

* `formality` threw an error for vectors of length 1.  This has been fixed. (Kurt 
  Hornik) See GitHub issue #151 for details.

NEW FEATURES

*  The `cm_xxx2long` family of functions (`cm_df2long`, `cm_range2long` and 
  `cm_time2long`) now have a generic wrapper, `cm_2long`, to generate the long
  formats.

* `hash_look` (and `%ha%`) a counterpart to `hash` added to allow quick access 
  to a hash table.  Intended for use within functions or multiple uses of the 
  same hash table, whereas `lookup` is intended for a single external (non 
  function) use which is more convenient though could be slower.

* `boolean_search`, a Boolean term search function, added to allow for indexed 
  searches of Boolean terms.

* `trans_context` is a printing function desired to grab the context (n rows 
  before and after) an event (an index from a vector of indices).  The function 
  prints the indices around the episode from a transcript to the console or a 
  .csv, .xlsx, .txt, or .doc file. 

* `colpaste2df` is a wrapper for `paste2` that pastes dataframe columns together 
  and outputs a dataframe.

* `colcomb2class` quickly combines columns for  number of qdap classes including 
  output from: `termco`, `question_type`, `pos_by`, and `character_table`.

* `lview` a function to unclass a list output that has a special print method 
  that returns only a portion of the output.  `lview` re-classes to "list".

* `word_cor` added to find words within grouping variables that are associated
  based on correlation.

* `tm2qdap` a function to convert `"TermDocumentMatrix"` and 
  `"DocumentTermMatrix"` to a `wfm` added to allow easier integration with the 
  `tm` package.

* `apply_as_tm` a function to allow functions intended to be used on the `tm` 
  package's `TermDocumentMatrix` to be applied to a `wfm` object.

* `tm_corpus2df` and `df2tm_corpus` added to convert a tm package corpus to a 
  dataframe for use in qdap or vice versa.

* `tdm` and `dtm` are now truly compatible with the `tm` package.  `tdm` and 
  `dtm` produce outputs of the class `"TermDocumentMatrix"` and 
  `"DocumentTermMatrix"` respectively.  This change (coupled with the renaming 
  of `stopwords` to `rm_stopwords`) should make the two packages logical 
  companions and further extend the qdap package to integrate with the many 
  packages that already handle `"TermDocumentMatrix"` and 
  `"DocumentTermMatrix"`.

* `cm_distance` now uses resampling of data from the null model to generate
  pvalues for the mean code distances.  Useful for determining if an association 
  (small distance) between codes is likely to happen if the null is true.

*  `dispersion_plot` added to enable viewing of word dispersion through 
  discourse.

* `word_proximity` added to compliment `dispersion_plot` and `word_cor` 
  functions.  `word_proximity` gives the average distance between words in 
  the unit of sentences.

MINOR FEATURES

* `url_dl` now takes quoted string urls supplied to ... (no url argument is 
  supplied)

* `condense` is a function that condense dataframe columns that are a list of 
  vectors to a single vector of strings.  This outputs a dataframe with 
  condensed columns that can be wrote to csv/xlsx.

* `mcsv_w` now uses `condense` to attempt to attempt to condense columns that are 
  lists of vectors to a single vector of strings.  This adds flexibility to 
  `mcsv_w` with more data sets.  `mcsv_w` now writes lists of dataframes to 
  multiple csvs (e.g., the output from `termco` or `polarity`).  `mcsv_w` picks
  up a dataframes argument, an optional character vector supplied in lieu of 
  \ldots that grabs the dataframes from an environment (default id the Global
  environment).

* `ngrams` now has an argument ellipsis that passes further arguments supplied 
  to `strip`

* `dtm` added to compliment `tdm`, allowing for easier integration with other R 
  packages that utilize `tdm`/`dtm`.

* `dir_map` picks up a `use.path` argument that allows the user to specify a 
  more flexible path to the created pre-formed `read.transcript` scripts based 
  on something like `file.path(getwd(), )`.  This means portability of code on 
  different machines.

* `polarity_frame` a function to make a hash environment lookup for use with the 
  `polarity` function.

* `DATA.SPLIT` a `sentSplit` version of the `DATA` data-set has been added to 
  qdap.

* `gantt_plot` accepts NULL for `grouping.var` and figures for "all" rows as a 
  single grouping var.

* `replace_number` now handles 10^47 digits compared to 10^14 previously.

* The `new_project` function gains a `github` argument that optionally sends the 
  repo to GitHub public account upon creation.

* `qheat`, `polarity.plot` and `formality.plot` pick up the argument `plot` 
  which optionally suppresses the plotting.  This is useful if the user is 
  operating in **knitr**, **sewave**, etc. and wishes to alter/add onto the plot.

* `lookup` now takes `missing = NULL`.  This results in the original values in
  `terms` corresponding to the missing elements being retained.

* `cm_time.temp` picks up a `grouping.var` argument that works similarly to 
  `cm_range.temp`'s `grouping.var`.  `cm_time.temp` also takes hour values for
  `start` and `end` as in `end = "01:22:03"`.

* `gantt_rep` picks up a generic `plot` method.

* Functions in the `cm_code.xxx` and `cm_xxx2long` pick up a generic plot method
  that utilizes `gantt_wrap` to plot a Gantt plot of the span data.

* Functions in the `cm_code.xxx` and `cm_xxx2long` pick up a generic summary 
  method.  This summary method has its own plot method that utilizes `qheat` to 
  plot a heatmap of the summary statistics.  The generic print method 
  (`print.sum_cmspans`) is useful for output intended for publication.

* `qheat` picks up a `facet.vars` argument that allows a character vector of 
  length 1 or 2 to facet by.

* `question_type` gives the indices of questions via `$inds`.

* `colsplit2df` not splits multiple columns to match the capabilities of 
  `colpaste2df`.

* `sentSplit` now handles repeated measures and picks up a turn of talk plot 
  method.

* `tot_plot` now handles repeated measures and `grouping.var` to be nested 
  within the turn of talk.

* `wfm` now uses `mtabulate` and is ~10x faster.

* `plot.polarity` gains arguments for optional error bars using the standard 
  error of the mean polarity.

* `exclude` now works with `wfm` and the `tm` package's `DocumentTermMatrix` and
  `TermDocumentMatrix` classes.

* `rm_url` removes/replaces URLs in a string(s).

* `matrix2df` added (under `list2df`) to convert `rownames` of matrix to a 
  dataframe column.

CHANGES

* The dictionaries and word lists for qdap have been moved to their own package, 
  `qdapDictionaries`.  This will allow easier access to these resources beyond 
  the qdap package as well as reducing the overall size of the qdap package.  
  Because this is a major change that make break the code of some users the 
  major release number has been upped to 1.  The following name changes have 
  occurred:

    - `increase.amplification.words` -> became -> `amplification.words`

    - The `deamplification.words` wordlist  and `env.pol` dictionary were added as 
        well.

* qdap gains an HTML package vignette to better explain the intended work flow 
  and function use for the package.  This is not currently a part of the build 
  but can be accessed via:

  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/trinker/qdap/blob/master/vignettes/qdap_vignette.html

  *Note* that the vignette may include development version functions not yet 
  available in the current CRAN version

* `polarity` utilizes a new, unbounded algorithm based on weighting to determine 
  polarity.

* `gantt_wrap` no longer accepts unquoted strings to the `plot.var` argument.

* `cm_df.temp` loses the logical `csv` argument.  `file.name` have been replaced 
  with `file` to fit conventional R naming schemes.

* The plotting feature of `gantt` has been removed and a `plot` method has been 
  added.  The user can plot the output from `gantt` in `base` or `ggplot2` 
  graphics.

* `cm_time2long` loses the argument `start.end` to ensure that the `cmspans` 
  class produced would operate as expected.

* Most exported functions utilizing a period separator have been replaced with 
  underscore named versions.

* `wf_combine` renamed `wfm_combine` to be consistent.

* `question_type` algorithm improvements including implied do/does/did handling.

* `list2df` and `mtabulate` now exported.

* `stopwords` has been renamed to `rm_stopwords`(`rm_stop` shorthand) to better 
  fit what the action the function performs and to avoid conflicts with the 
  `tm` package.

* `replace_number`'s `num.paste` becomes logical rather than character input.
  This makes use easier as the user doesn't need to remember arguments.


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 0.2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------

Patch release.  This version deals with the changes in the `openNLP` package 
  that effect qdap.  Next major release scheduled after `slidify` package is 
  pushed to CRAN.

qdap 0.2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES

* `new_project` placed a report in the CORRESPONDENCE directory rather than 
  CONTACT_INFO

* `strip` would not allow the characters "/" and "-" to be passed to 
  `char.keep`.  This has been fixed. (Jens Engelmann)

* `beg2end` would only grab first character of a string after n -1 occurrences of 
  the character.  For example: 
  `beg2char(c("abc-edw-www", "nmn-ggg", "rer-qqq-fdf"), "-", 2)` resulted in
  "abc-e" "nmn-g" "rer-q" rather than "abc-edw" "nmn-ggg" "rer-qqq"

NEW FEATURES

* `names2sex` a function for predicting gender from name.

* Added `NAMES` and `NAMES_SEX` data-sets, based on 1990 U.S. census data.

* `tdm` added as an equivalent to TermDocumentMatrix from the tm package.  This 
  allows for portability across text analysis packages.

MINOR FEATURES

* `mgsub` now gets a `trim` argument that optionally removes trailing leading 
  white spaces.

* `lookup` now takes a list of named vectors for the key.match argument.

CHANGES

* `new_project` directory can now be transferred without breaking paths (i.e.,
  `file.path(getwd(), "DIR/file.ext")` is used rather than the full file path).


CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 0.2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `genXtract` labels returned the word "right" rather than the right edge string.
  See http://stackoverflow.com/a/15423439/1000343 for an example of the old 
  behavior.  This behavior has been fixed.

* `gradient_cloud`'s `min.freq ` locked at 1.  This has been fixed. (Manuel 
  Fdez-Moya)

* `termco` would produce an error if single length named vectors were passed to 
  match.list and no multi-length vectors were supplied.  Also an error was thrown 
  if an unnamed multi-length vector was passed to `match.list`.  This behavior has 
  been fixed.

NEW FEATURES

* `tot_plot` a visualizing function that uses a bar graph to visualize patterns 
  in sentence length and grouping variables by turn of talk.

* `beg2char` and `char2end` functions to grab text from beginning of string to a
  character or from a character to the end of a string.

* `ngrams` function to calculate ngrams by grouping variable.

MINOR FEATURES

* `genX` and `bracketX` gain an extra argument `space.fix` to remove extra 
  spaces left over from bracket removal.

* Updated out of date Dropbox url download in `url_dl`.  `url_dl` also takes the 
  Dropbox key as well.

CHANGES

* qdap is now compiled for mac users (as `openNLP` now passes CRAN checks with no
  Errors on Mac).

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `word_associate` colors the word cloud appropriately and deals with the error 
  caused by a grouping variable not containing any words from 1 or more of the 
  vectors of a list supplied to match string

* `trans.cloud` produced an error when expand.target was TRUE.  This error has 
  been eliminated.

* `termco` would eliminate > 1 columns matching an identical search.term found 
  in a second vector of match.list.  termco now counts repeated terms multiple 
  times.

* `cm_df.transcript` did not give the correct speaker labels (fixed).

NEW FEATURES

* `gradient_cloud`: Binary gradient Word Cloud - A new plotting function 
  that plots and colors words for a binary variable based on which group of 
  the binary variable uses the term more frequently.

* `new_project`: A project template generating function designed to increase 
  efficiency and standardize work flow.  The project comes with a .Rproj file 
  for easy use with RStudio as well as a .Rprofile that makes loading and sourcing 
  of packages, data and project functions.  This function uses the reports package
  to generate an extensive reports folder.


MINOR FEATURES

* `stemmer`, `stem2df` and `stem.words` now explicitly have the argument 
  `char.keep` set to "~~" to enable retaining special character formerly stripped 
  away.

* `hms2sec`: A function to convert from h:m:s format to seconds.

* `mcsv_w` now takes a list of data.frames.

* `cm_range.temp` now takes the arguments text.var and grouping.var that will 
  automatically output these (grouping.var) columns as range coded indices.

* `wfm` gets as speed boost as the code has been re-written to be faster.

* `read.transcript` now reads .txt files as well as text similar to read.table.

CHANGES

* `sec2hms` is the new name for `convert` 

* `folder` and `delete` have been moved to the reports package which is imported 
  by qdap.  Previously `folder` would not generate a directory with the 
  time/date stamp if no directory name was given; this has been fixed, though 
  the function now resides in the reports package.

CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The first installation of the qdap package

* Package designed to bridge the gap between qualitative data and quantitative 
  analysis
