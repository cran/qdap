qdap 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `word_associate` colors the word cloud appropriately and deals with the error 
  caused by a grouping variable not containing any words from 1 or more of the 
  vectors of a list supplied to match string

* `trans.cloud` produced an error when expand.target was TRUE.  This error ha 
  been eliminated.

* `termco` would eliminate > 1 columns matching an identical search.term found 
  in a second vector of match.list.  termco now counts repeated terms multiple 
  times.

* `cm_df.transcript` did not give the correct speaker labels (fixed).

NEW FEATURES

* `bivar_gradcloud`: Binary gradient Word Cloud - A new plotting function 
  that plots and colors words for a binary variable based on which group of 
  the binary variable uses the term more frequently.

* `new_project`: A project template generating function designed to increase 
  efficiency and standardize work flow.  The project comes with a .Rproj file 
  for easy use with RStudio as well as a .Rprofile that makes loading and sourcing 
  of packages, data and project functions.  This function uses the reprots package
  to generate an extensive reports folder.

MINOR FEATURES

* `stemmer`, `stem2df` and `stem.words` now explicitally have the argument 
  char.keep set to "~~" to enable retaining special character formerly stripped 
  away.

* `hms2sec`: A function to convert from h:m:s format to seconds.

* `mcsv_w` now takes a list of data.frames.

* `cm_range.temp` now takes the arguments text.var and grouping.var that will 
  automatically output these (grouping.var) columns as range coded indices.

* `wfm` gets as speed boost as the code has been re-written to be faster.

* `read.transcript` now reads .txt files as well as text similar to read.table.

CHANGES

* `sec2hms` is the new name for `convert` 

* `folder` and `delete` have been moved to the reports package which is imported 
  by qdap.  Previously `folder` would not generate a directory with the 
  time/date stamp if no directory name was given; this has been fixed, though 
  the function now resides in the reprots package.

qdap 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The first installation of the qdap package

* Package designed to bridge the gap between qualitative data and quantitative 
  analysis
