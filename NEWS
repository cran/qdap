qdap 0.2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `new_project` placed a report in the CORRESPONDENCE directory rather than 
  CONTACT_INFO

* `strip` would not allow the characters "/" and "-" to be passed to 
  `char.keep`.  This has been fixed. (Jens Engelmann)

* `beg2end` would only grab first character of a string after n -1 occurrences of 
  the character.  For example: 
  `beg2char(c("abc-edw-www", "nmn-ggg", "rer-qqq-fdf"), "-", 2)` resulted in
  "abc-e" "nmn-g" "rer-q" rather than "abc-edw" "nmn-ggg" "rer-qqq"

NEW FEATURES

* `names2sex` a function for predicting gender from name.

* Added `NAMES` and `NAMES_SEX` datasets, based on 1990 U.S. census data.

* `tdm` added as an equivalent to TermDocumentMatrix from the tm package.  This 
  allows for portability across text analysis packages.

MINOR FEATURES

* `mgsub` now gets a `trim` argument that optionally reomves trailing leading 
  white spaces.

* `lookup` now takes a list of named vectors for the key.match argument.

CHANGES

* `new_project` directory can now be transfered without breaking paths (i.e.,
  `file.path(getwd(), "DIR/file.ext")` is used rather than the full file path).


qdap 0.2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `genXtract` labels returned the word "right" rather than the right edge string.
  See http://stackoverflow.com/a/15423439/1000343 for an example of the old 
  behavior.  This behavior has been fixed.

* `gradient_cloud`'s `min.freq ` locked at 1.  This has been fixed. (Manuel 
  Fdez-Moya)

* `termco` would produce an error if single length named vectors were passed to 
  match.list and no multilength vectors were supplied.  Also an error was thrown 
  if an unnamed multilength vector was passed to match.list.  This behavior has 
  been fixed.

NEW FEATURES

* `tot_plot` a visualizing function that uses a bar graph to visualize patterns 
  in sentence length and grouping variables by turn of talk.

* `beg2char` and `cahr2end` functions to grab text from beginning of string to a
  character or from a character to the end of a string.

* `ngrams` function to calculate ngrams by grouping variable.

MINOR FEATURES

* `genX` and `bracketX` gain an extra argument `space.fix` to remove extra 
  spaces left over from bracket removal.

* Updated out of date dropbox url download in `url_dl`.  `url_dl` also takes the 
  dropbox key as well.

CHANGES

* qdap is now compiled for mac users (as openNLP now passes CRAN checks with no
  Errors on Mac).

qdap 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `word_associate` colors the word cloud appropriately and deals with the error 
  caused by a grouping variable not containing any words from 1 or more of the 
  vectors of a list supplied to match string

* `trans.cloud` produced an error when expand.target was TRUE.  This error has 
  been eliminated.

* `termco` would eliminate > 1 columns matching an identical search.term found 
  in a second vector of match.list.  termco now counts repeated terms multiple 
  times.

* `cm_df.transcript` did not give the correct speaker labels (fixed).

NEW FEATURES

* `gradient_cloud`: Binary gradient Word Cloud - A new plotting function 
  that plots and colors words for a binary variable based on which group of 
  the binary variable uses the term more frequently.

* `new_project`: A project template generating function designed to increase 
  efficiency and standardize work flow.  The project comes with a .Rproj file 
  for easy use with RStudio as well as a .Rprofile that makes loading and sourcing 
  of packages, data and project functions.  This function uses the reprots package
  to generate an extensive reports folder.

MINOR FEATURES

* `stemmer`, `stem2df` and `stem.words` now explicitally have the argument 
  char.keep set to "~~" to enable retaining special character formerly stripped 
  away.

* `hms2sec`: A function to convert from h:m:s format to seconds.

* `mcsv_w` now takes a list of data.frames.

* `cm_range.temp` now takes the arguments text.var and grouping.var that will 
  automatically output these (grouping.var) columns as range coded indices.

* `wfm` gets as speed boost as the code has been re-written to be faster.

* `read.transcript` now reads .txt files as well as text similar to read.table.

CHANGES

* `sec2hms` is the new name for `convert` 

* `folder` and `delete` have been moved to the reports package which is imported 
  by qdap.  Previously `folder` would not generate a directory with the 
  time/date stamp if no directory name was given; this has been fixed, though 
  the function now resides in the reprots package.

qdap 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The first installation of the qdap package

* Package designed to bridge the gap between qualitative data and quantitative 
  analysis
