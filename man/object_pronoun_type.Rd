\title{Count Object Pronouns Per Grouping Variable}
\usage{
object_pronoun_type(
  text.var,
  grouping.var = NULL,
  object.pronoun.list = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable}

\item{grouping.var}{The grouping variables.  Default \code{NULL} generates 
one word list for all text.  Also takes a single grouping variable or a list

\item{object.pronoun.list}{A named list of object pronouns.  See 
\strong{Details} for more.}

\item{\ldots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[qdap]{termco}}}
}
\value{
Returns a list, of class "object_pronoun_type", of data frames 
regarding object pronoun word counts:
\item{preprocessed}{List of uncollapsed dataframes (raw, prop, rnp) of the class "termco" that contain all searchable object pronouns.} 
\item{raw}{raw word counts by grouping variable} 
\item{prop}{proportional word counts by grouping variable; proportional to 
each individual's object pronoun use} 
\item{rnp}{a character combination data frame of raw and proportional object pronoun use}
}
\description{
Count the number of object pronouns per grouping variables.
}
\details{
The following object pronoun categories are the default searched terms:
\itemize{
    \item me = c(" me ", " my ", " mine ")
