\title{qdap: Quantitative Discourse Analysis Package}
\description{
This package automates many of the tasks associated with quantitative 
discourse analysis of transcripts containing discourse.  The package 
provides parsing tools for preparing transcript data, coding tools and 
analysis tools for richer understanding of the data.  Many functions 
allow the user to aggregate data by any number of grouping variables, 
providing analysis and seamless integration with other R packages which 
enable higher level analysis and visualization of text.  This empowers 
the researcher with more flexible, efficient and targeted methods and tools.
