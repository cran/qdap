\arguments{
\item{project}{A character vector of the project name.}

\item{path}{The path to where the project should be created.  Default is the 
current working directory.}

\item{open}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the project will be opened in RStudio.
The default is to test if \code{new_project} is being used in the global

    } 
}
\item{DATA}{ - A directory to store data:}
\itemize{

\item{PLOTS}{ - A directory to store plots}
\item{REPORTS}{ - A directory with report and presentation related tools.}
\item{SCRIPTS}{ - A directory to store scripts; already contains the following:
\itemize{
    \item{01_clean_data.R}{ - initial cleaning of raw transcripts}
    \item{02_analysis_I.R}{ - initial analysis}
    \item{03_plots.R}{ - plotting script}
    }
}
\item{TABLES}{ - A directory to export tables to}  
\item{WORD_LISTS}{ - A directory to store word lists that can be sourced and supplied to functions}
\item{.Rprofile}{ - Performs certain tasks such as loading libraries, data and sourcing functions upon startup in \href{http://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio}} 
\item{extra_functions.R}{ - A script to store user made functions related to the project
\itemize{
    \item{email}{ - A function to view, and optionally copy to the clipboard, emails for the client/lead researcher, analyst and/or other project members (information taking from ~/CORRESPONDENCE/CONTACT_INFO.txt file)}

\item{PROJECT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.pdf}{ - A pdf explaining the structure of the project template}
\item{xxx.Rproj}{ - A project file used by \href{http://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio}; clicking this will open the project in RStudio.} 
\item{TO_DO}{ - A text file documenting project tasks}
}

The template comes with a .Rproj file.  This makes operating in 
\href{http://www.rstudio.com/}{RStudio} very easy.  The file can be kept on 
the desktop or a git application such as \href{https://github.com/}{github},
\href{https://bitbucket.org/}{bitbucket} or \href{https://www.dropbox.com/}{dropbox}, 
depending on what the client/research team is comfortable utilizing.
