\usage{
\method{Animate}{polarity}(x, negative = "blue", positive = "red",
  neutral = "yellow", edge.constant, wc.time = TRUE, time.constant = 2,
  title = NULL, digits = 3, current.color = "black",
  current.speaker.color = NULL, non.speaker.color = NA,
  ave.color.line = "red", as.network = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[qdap]{polarity}} object.}

\item{negative}{The color to use for negative polarity.}

\item{positive}{The color to use for positive polarity.}

\item{neutral}{The color to use for neutral polarity.}

\item{edge.constant}{A constant to multiple edge width by.}

\item{wc.time}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} weights duration of frame by word
count.}

\item{time.constant}{A constant to divide the maximum word count by.  Time
is calculated by `round(exp(WORD COUNT/(max(WORD COUNT)/time.constant)))`.
Therefore a larger constant will make the difference between the large and
small word counts greater.}

\item{title}{The title to apply to the animated image(s).}

\item{digits}{The number of digits to use in the current turn of talk
polarity.}

\item{current.color}{The color to use for the current turn of talk polarity.}

\item{current.speaker.color}{The color for the current speaker.}

\item{non.speaker.color}{The color for the speakers not currently speaking.}

\item{ave.color.line}{The color to use for the average color line if
\code{network = FALSE}.}

\item{as.network}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the animation is a network plot.
If \code{FALSE} the animation is a hybrid dot plot.}

\item{\ldots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[qdap]{discourse_map}}.}

polarity Method for Animate
}
\note{
The width of edges is based on words counts on that edge until that
moment divided by total number of words used until that moment.  Thicker
edges tend to thin as time passes.  The actual duration the current edge
stays as the \code{current.color} is based on word counts for that particular
flow of dialogue divided by total dialogue (words) used.  The edge label is
the current polarity for that turn of talk (an aggregation of the sub
sentences of the current turn of talk).  The coloring of the current edge
polarity is produced at th sentence level, therefor a label may indicate a
positive current turn of talk, while the coloring may indicate a negative
sentences.
