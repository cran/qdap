\title{Map Transcript Files from a Directory to a Script}
\usage{
dir_map(
  loc = "DATA/TRANSCRIPTS/CLEANED_TRANSCRIPTS",
  obj.prefix = "dat",
  use.path = TRUE,
  col.names = c("person", "dialogue"),
  file = NULL,
  copy2clip = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc}{The path/location of the transcript data files.}

\item{obj.prefix}{A character string that will be used as the prefix (followed 
by a unique digit) as the assignment object.}

\item{use.path}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} use the actual path to the 
\code{loc} argument.  If \code{FALSE}, the  code may be more portable in that 
the actual input to \code{loc} is supplied to the 
\code{\link[qdap]{read.transcript}}.}

\item{col.names}{Supplies a vector of column names to the transcript columns.}

\item{file}{A connection, or a character string naming the file to print to.}

\item{copy2clip}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} attempts to copy the output to the 
clipboard.}
}
\value{
Prints a read in script text to the console, optionally copies the 
wrapped text to the clipboard on a Mac or Windows machine and optionally 
prints to an outside file.
}
\description{
Generate script text (and optionally output it to the clipboard and/or an 
external file) that can be used to individually read in every file in a 
directory and assign it to an object.
}
\details{
Generally, the researcher will want to read in and parse every 
transcript document separately.  The task of writing the script for multiple 
transcript documents can be tedious.  This function is designed to make the 
process more efficient and less prone to errors.
}
\note{
\code{skip} is set to 0, however, it is likely that this value will 
need to be changed for each transcript.
