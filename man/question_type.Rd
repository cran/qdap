\usage{
question_type(
  text.var,
  grouping.var = NULL,
  neg.cont = FALSE,
  percent = TRUE,
  zero.replace = 0,
  digits = 2,
  contraction = qdapDictionaries::contractions,
  bracket = "all",
  amplifiers = qdapDictionaries::amplification.words,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable}

\item{grouping.var}{The grouping variables.  Default \code{NULL} generates 
one word list for all text.  Also takes a single grouping variable or a list 
of 1 or more grouping variables.}

\item{neg.cont}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} provides separate counts for the 
negative contraction forms of the interrogative words.}

\item{percent}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} output given as percent.  If 
\code{FALSE} the output is proportion.}

\item{zero.replace}{Value to replace 0 values with.}

\item{digits}{Integer; number of decimal places to round when printing.}

\item{contraction}{A two column key of contractions (column 1) and expanded 
form replacements (column 2) or a vector of contractions.  Default is to use 
qdapDictionaries's \code{\link[qdapDictionaries]{contractions}} data set.}

\item{bracket}{The type of bracket (and encased text) to remove.  This is one 
or more of the strings \code{"curly"}, \code{"square"}, \code{"round"}, 
\code{"angle"} and \code{"all"}.  These strings correspond 
to: \{, [, (, < or all four types.}

\item{amplifiers}{A character vector of terms that increase the 
intensity of a positive or negative word. Default is to use 
qdapDictionaries's \code{\link[qdapDictionaries]{amplification.words}} data 
set.}

\item{\ldots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[qdap]{bracketX}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of:
\item{raw}{A dataframe of the questions used in the transcript and their 
type.}
\item{count}{A dataframe of total questions (\code{tot.quest}) and counts of 
question types (initial interrogative word) by grouping variable(s).}
\item{rnp}{Dataframe of the frequency and proportions of question types by 
grouping variable.} 
\item{inds}{The indices of the original text variable that contain questions.}
\item{missing}{The row numbers of the missing data (excluded from analysis).}
\item{percent}{The value of percent used for plotting purposes.}
\item{zero.replace}{The value of zero.replace used for plotting purposes.}
}

Transcript apply question counts.

\details{
The algorithm searches for the following interrogative words (and 
optionally, their negative contraction form as well): 
 
1) whose 2) whom 3) who 4) where 5) what 6) which 7) why 8) when 9) were* 
10) was* 11) does* 12) did* 13) do* 14) is 15) are* 16) will* 17) how 
18) should 19) could 20) would* 21) shall 22) may 23) might* 24) must* 
25) can* 26) has 27) have* 28) had* 29) ok 30) right 31) correct 
32) implied do/does/did

The interrogative word that is found first (with the exception of "ok", 
"right"/"alright", and "correct") in the question determines the sentence 
type. "ok", "right"/"alright", and "correct" sentence types are determined if 
the sentence is a question with no other interrogative words found and "ok", 
"right"/"alright", or "correct" is the last word of the sentence.  Those 
interrogative sentences beginning with the word "you", "wanna", or "want" are 
categorized as implying do/does/did question type, though the use of 
do/does/did is not explicit.  Those sentence beginning with "you" followed by 
a select interrogative word (and or their negative counter parts) above 
(marked with *) or 1-2 amplifier(s) followed by the select interrogative word
are categorized by the select word rather than an implied do/does/did 
question type.  A sentence that is marked "ok" over rides an implied 
do/does/did label.  Those with undetermined sentence type are labeled unknown.
